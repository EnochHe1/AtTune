### Important

You ***must*** have a Spotify account to run this website. The website will provide you with invalid Spotify pages if you do not do the following:

1. Add a .env file to Attune-main
2. Copy paste the following two lines into the .env file
`CLIENT_ID="Your_client_id"
CLIENT_SECRET="Your_client_secret"`
3. Your_client_id and Your-client-secret are **personal** inputs. Everyone will have a different client ID and client secret. You can get your client ID and client secret from [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
4. Login to your Spotify Account, and click on ‘Create an app’.
5. Pick an ‘App name’ and ‘App description’ of your choice and mark the checkboxes.
6. After creation, you see your ‘Client Id’ and you can click on ‘Show client secret` to unhide your ’Client secret’.
