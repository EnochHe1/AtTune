This platform offers Spotify playlists tailored to the user's emotions.

### Important

You ***must*** have a Spotify account to run this website since it utilizes the Spotify API. The website will provide you with invalid Spotify pages if you do not do the following:

1. Add a .env file to Attune-main
2. Copy paste the following two lines into the .env file

`CLIENT_ID="Your_client_id"`

`CLIENT_SECRET="Your_client_secret"`

3. Your_client_id and Your-client-secret are **personal** inputs. Everyone will have a unique client ID and client secret. You can get your client ID and client secret from [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
4. Login to your Spotify Account, and click on ‘Create an app’.
5. Pick an ‘App name’ and ‘App description’ of your choice and mark the checkboxes.
6. After creation, click on ‘Edit Settings‘ to view your client ID and client secret.
7. Once you've copy pasted your client ID and client secret into the .env vile, you're good to go!
